# watdoc.py

This simple script generates markdown files with function and class stubs as
headers and the docstring as descriptions to every function, or class in every
file provided as an argument to the program. It prints to screen only, so just
redirect output.

For when you don't want something heavyweight but want documentation in the code
base.
